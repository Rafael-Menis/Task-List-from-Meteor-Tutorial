Lesson in implementing running on android in windows.

Step 1- you need to have the android sdk, most likely through android studio.
Step 2- you need to have jdk 8, not 10
Step 3- you need to update the path variables. An important point here is that JAVA_HOME should be C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.whatever
NOT with /bin after that. (thanks to https://stackoverflow.com/a/1184098 for that)! If you have C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.whatever\bin as your JAVA_HOME path, it will break meteor run android by saying you don't have a virtual machine.
If you go to C:\Users\@USERNAME\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\tools\bin in command line or powershell
and try to run avdmanager.bat, it will say "error java_home is set to an invalid directory".
Step 4- once you've done all these things, cordova will still crash with a horrendous error chain
partway through building your app, of which the only relevant part is "TypeError: Cannot read property 'semver' of null".
By default, the version of cordova that meteor builds with version 1.7 of meteor really doesn't
like uncertainty. If there are any versions of android other than the exact one that it wants
for the virtual image, it crashes (credit to https://stackoverflow.com/a/47947319). You can fix this by
"
    find the path <project_root>/platforms/android/cordova/lib/emulator.js
    find the line avd.target = 'Android ' + level.semver + ' (API level ' + api_level + ')';
    replace it with avd.target = 'Android ' + (level ? level.semver : '') + ' (API level ' + api_level + ')';
" (credit to https://stackoverflow.com/a/48184965).
For a meteor build, you're looking for .meteor/local/cordova-build/platforms/android/cordova/lib/emulator.js.
Once you've done that, you can finally build your app in android on windows by using meteor run android.
